# Jiji's Diner 🍔🍕🥞

This project is part of the **Codédex HTML Final Project**.  
It’s a fully structured restaurant menu webpage built with pure HTML (and a little CSS for styling). The project demonstrates core HTML skills such as semantic structure, forms, labels, navigation, and basic styling.

## 📖 Project Overview
- **Header** with a banner image, restaurant name, and navigation links.
- **Main Content** split into two sections:
  - **Menu Section**: Three menu items (pancakes, burger, pizza), each with an image, description, and price.
  - **Order Form Section**: A functional form where customers can:
    - Choose quantities with number inputs.
    - Select add-ons using checkboxes/radio buttons.
    - Add special requests with a textarea.
    - Submit the form via a “Go To Checkout” button.
- **Footer** with a personalized message: *“Made with love by LdLightMan”*.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Semantic HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).
- Forms with inputs, labels, checkboxes, radio buttons, and textarea.
- Linking sections with navigation anchors.
- Basic inline/internal CSS for layout and presentation.
- Accessibility best practices (`id` + `for`, grouping with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`).
